Gate Result: **PASS**
- Build, lint, and tests passed across workspace crates under strict budget (`-j 1`, `--test-threads=1`, `neoveg_ui` excluded from `cargo test`).
- Zero third-party trademarks in runtime strings or translation catalogs.
- Translation catalogs (1,795 keys) 100% synchronized with matching `{}` format counts.
- `neoveg_aaf/src/tests.rs`, `neoveg_video/src/raw.rs`, `neoveg_video/src/still.rs` verified clean.
- Interrupted recording workflow with input device selection, track arming, and memory ring monitoring verified in headless CI via mock loopback and 13 adversarial tests.
- Forensic Auditor verdict: CLEAN.
